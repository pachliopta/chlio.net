Touhou's 20th entry has made its way to steam. With it, a particular disclaimer on the store page:

> _Some background textures include Al-generated content._

> _There is nothing that is being generated live in real-time by Al._

Oh dear.

This has been the reality of the Touhou project for 2 years now, with the 19th entry also heavily utilising such backgrounds - albeit skirting steam's disclosure rules. This is not a post about the veracity of these any of these images, they [speak](https://imgur.com/a/xq8mm5i) for [themselves](https://imgur.com/a/zY7KhSj).

When the demo disk first released at Reitaisai I made a comment on a website lightly lambasting ZUN's use of AI and general lack of effort.
This comment was reposted to another website and in general contributed to ongoing feelings of disappointment. Since then,
the conversation seems split. This is a post about a pervasive line of thought:

### _"It's just the background textures, who cares?"_

First, allow me to state confidently: it's not just the background textures, nor is it "some". Almost every texture that isn't obviously ZUN's drawing or a SFX is AI-generated. Disabuse yourself of the notion that this was a mistake. Or that this is the result of pesky stock image websites. The inclusion and production of these images is a conscious decision on ZUN's behalf. [Don't just take my word for it](https://bsky.app/profile/richardeffendi.bsky.social/post/3lotbwg4hvs2c).

By being ambivalent you are contributing to the dilution of art in greater society. You are permitting billionaires to chip away at your soul and hijack any potential you and future generations have at learning organically. All for the sake of VC money and a capitalist death cult.

In the domain of video games, I consider generative AI's impact on the sort of texture you glance at and move along to be among the most offensive. The sort of asset few even notice, the ones that blend into nothingness amongst the greater scene. The type of thing that makes people say, "well, if it wasn't for AI, they would've just grabbed something from a stock library." The type of thing of thing you might shrug at and think, "well, it's not like the whole game was AI generated."

Next time you're outside, look out for the very many instances of human creation. A washed-out mural on a side of a building, the iconography of a take-out shop that makes you laugh, a statue in a mall that's been there your whole life, but you've never thought about who or what it represents. This is what you're advocating the destruction of. Each and every one a piece of art that has afforded someone a meal and you a richer life. Despite everything, we're lucky to be able to experience the mundane art all around us. I want no part in a world without it.

In the future, after many more billions have been poured into this - after Valve removes the AI disclaimer due to a perceived redundancy, where does that place games? Do you seriously want to pig out to a markov chain's depiction of Gensoukyou after a long day of swimming in a dead internet? After every game has thoroughly immersed themselves in AI textures, will you be happy when the cast of Touhou 50 is AI-generated? I mean, it's not like the danmaku was AI-generated right?

Stop enabling this.

### AI isn't going anywhere, but the next indie darling is.

Tobacco isn't going anywhere, and that's why I'm smoking a few packs a day. Climate change isn't going anywhere, that's why I'm an advocate for sinking oil tankers in the pacific.

As we continue to lower the bar of what's considered an acceptable addition to a video game, put yourself in the shoes of a prospective indie developer. One that must compete with the increasingly endless stream of slurry you are gleefully gobbling up.

Touhou itself is a stand-out success in the Japanese doujin scene. At the core of its generous fan community is a series that at release was a genuinely novel and innovative take on PC SHUMPs. An individual's drawings, compositions, and bullet patterns coming together to be burned to a disk and released at comiket. When this is all regurgitated back to you from the mouth of silicon valley, what's left for future developers?

It's an appreciation of the immortal arcade SHMUP that allowed the Touhou project to exist. It is groups like Taito's Zuntata and CAVE's array of composers that inspired Touhou's music.

It is one's embrace of art that inspires games like this. A loving embrace of the work of those around you and a tedious personal desire to be apart of that for others.

Removing our connection to others and the purposeful, inspired actions we take to maintain it is not giving us better games.

Stop enabling the antithesis of creation.

### Play better games

I like the Touhou games and I love the wonderful amalgamation of human effort that has awarded the project its continued fame. This community will never cease to exist - but maybe that love deserves to bloom elsewhere.

If you enjoy the Touhou games for their gameplay, why not branch out into some other indie SHMUPs? Some of them have anime girls and the colour orange! Here's some that are both fun and great entry points to the genre at large!
